## Comparison-based algorithms:
- [x] Bubble Sort
- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Insertion Sort
- [x] Merge Sort
- [x] Quicksort
- [] Heap Sort
- [] Timsort

## Non-comparison based algorithms:
- [ ] Radix sort  
- [ ] Counting sort  

## Features
- [ ] Show current data array
- [ ] Create nearly sorted array
- [ ] Restart Visualization
- [ ] Stop Visualization (if possible)
- [ ] Sorting speed comparison table (Rewrite algorithms without drawing for efficiency)
